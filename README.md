# Ben Merchant dot Dev - Redux

My first attempt at a portfolio site can be found here: https://benmerchant.github.io

My second attempt, the site this one will replace is: https://benmerchant.dev
(note: by the end of this sprint, June 22, this domain will go to the site I'm working on now in this repo)

I'd like to mention. I am a full stack developer. I am NOT a graphic/website designer. That's not my forte nor is it something I plan to get good at. So, just appreciate the functionality please. Thanks.
