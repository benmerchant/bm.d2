Ben Merchant dot Dev - Redux

My first attempt at a portfolio site can be found here: https://benmerchant.github.io

My second attempt, the site this one will replace is: https://benmerchant.dev (note: by the end of this sprint, June 22, this domain will go to the site I'm working on now in this repo)

I'd like to mention. I am a full stack developer. I am NOT a graphic/website designer. That's not my forte nor is it something I plan to get good at. So, just appreciate the functionality please. Thanks.

Part of the reason for the *Link Lister* feature [Sprint 01: User Story D] is to have somewhere I can store all of the bookmarks I have on Chrome and Firefox as well as be able to comment on them. No developer is out here creating apps without Stack Overflow or the random blog they found on Google. I just want to list them all and give those nameless devs out there a little credit!
